      <p>I will change jobs and quit working remotely.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I decided to quit working remotely.<br />
I will move to Tokyo.<br />
I started my job at February 2017, and had worked remotely for 1.5 years.<br />
It was challenging days, and I could got special colleagues.<br />
I really appreciate at all.<br />
I miss working remotely, but I decided stop it.<br />
I really love it, but it has some weakness.</p>

<h3 id="unmatch-of-communication-speed">Unmatch of communication speed</h3>

<p>Everyone has their own communication pace.<br />
When we talk at Slack, or any other tools,<br />
our conversation speed must follow for most slowest person.<br />
People who reply fastly expect others to reply fastly.<br />
So, it may be stress for them.</p>

<h3 id="difficult-at-greeting-and-chatting">Difficult at greeting and chatting</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s very important have greeting and chatting for all teams.<br />
Especially, we must create software together and we should have strong teamwork.<br />
I think that team that works with teammates like playing with frineds can do great stuffs.<br />
Casual greeting and chatting helps it.<br />
We shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of taking feedback each other.</p>

<p>Working remotely is great way to decrease our stress.<br />
I felt few stress for these days and love it.<br />
I want to write about working together and difference of them some time soon.</p>
